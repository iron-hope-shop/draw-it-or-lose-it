# Draw It or Lose It

## Prompt
# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Draw It or Lose It is loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.  


The staff at The Gaming Room does not know how to set up the environment. To facilitate the development of the web-based version of the gaming app, they will need your help in streamlining the development. You have been asked to prepare a software design document and begin developing the game application, addressing their software requirements. Keep in mind that the hardware requirements will come later as a result of the software application decisions. Your technical manager will want to review your progress with this client.  


Specifically, the client has requested that the following **software requirements** be met for the game application:  
- A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
- Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
- Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
- Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I enjoyed cross-examining the target host and client operating systems in order to come to a conlusion on the best architecture that met the client's needs.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document was helpful to make myself familiar with the object-oriented principles that carried over to the source code of the application.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
There is nothing I would like to revise other than maybe adding more detail throughout.  The biggest issue I had was that I wanted to rename the project and change the logo but I never made an effort to do so.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I designed my implementation based on the user's needs.  This was important because they knew what they wanted for their user base and I did not.  If I had stepped in and changed the fundamental requirements of the application it would no longer be the same vision.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
It helped that a lot of the boilerplate code was already written for us and that I have created RESTful Java services before.  I created the outlines as required and translated that to the application code.
